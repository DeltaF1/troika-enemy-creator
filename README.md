# Troika! Enemy Creator

[Live version on glitch.me](https://troika-enemy-creator.glitch.me/)

This is a small HTML tool to create enemy cards similar to those in the Troika! playbook.

It should work out of the box opened locally in the browser, but for best functionality should be run on a (local!) web server with write access so that enemy data and images can be stored between sessions.
